# GOF - Design patterns
Divided into three groups

## Behavioral
## Creational

## Structural
#### Composite
On this pattern I created based on tree file system which is possible count total size on folder's tree.\
Principal point of this implementation is on possibility that you can count total all files without know a real concrete class, using abstraction of java class 'Path'.\
