# GOF - Design patterns
Divided into three groups

## Behavioral
## Creational

## Structural
#### Composite
On this pattern I created based on tree file system which is possible count total size on folder's tree.\
Principal point of this implementation is on possibility that you can count total all files without know a real concrete class, using abstraction of java class 'Path'.\

BONUS: for this particular implementation I made a rudimentary console on System.in wich is possible to create folders, files and navigate between them. Check it out!

`Just run this java main class and input in System.in some linux comands like as cd, mkdir, ls.`
